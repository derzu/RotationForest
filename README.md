# What does this project do?

It's an implementation of the Rotation Forest Algorithm from paper from Kuncheva and Rodríguez, 2016. It's a MCS (Multiple Classifier Systems) and it's result is compared with the bagging MCS.

The training an classification stages are run. It's tested using an 10-fold cross validation process.

# Before Run

* Add all folders to Matlab path
* PRTools Decision Tree is used.
* Download PRTools and add it's folder to the root folder of this project, and add to Matlab's path.
